= NOD Open Source Eventually License

Version {revision}

[[preamble]]
Preamble
^^^^^^^^

Everyone loves Free/Libre (as in "free speech") and Open Source Things!
Now software, hardware, art and even bioware are available under
licenses that respect the freedom of their users. However, it can be
difficult to make money selling Open Source Things when those Things can
be made available without cost (as in "free beer"). We need a way to be
able to temporarily limit users freedoms in order to ensure that the
creators of great Open Source stuff can pay mortgages and buy food.

This license limits your freedom to share the Thing(s) (software,
hardware, art, bioware, whatever) for a specific amount of time. During
that time, only the original creator (Licensor) of the Thing(s) has the
right to share this "thing". After a predetermined and reasonable amount
of time, this license will automatically convert to an Free/Libre Open
Source license, ensuring that you have the right to share the original
Thing(s), and any improvements you have made to this Thing(s), under the
terms of an Open Source License.

The files associated with the Thing(s) in question should include:

* OSELicense.txt -> This license without modification.
* STARTINGLICENSE.txt -> An optional file containing permissions and restrictions that apply before the conversion to the end license
* ENDLICENSE.txt -> The Open Source License that this license will
convert to.
* CONVERSTIONDATE.txt -> A file containing the date when conversion will
take place
* COPYRIGHT.txt -> A file listing copyright holder(s) of the Thing(s)
including an email address

The functioning of this license is simple. Creators (Licensors) make the
Thing(s) (software/hardware/whatever) and then release them using these
files, which detail what Open Source License the Thing(s) will convert
to and when that conversion occurs. Further clarifications are included
in the legalspeak below.

Please read this License carefully before accessing or using the
licensed Things. By accessing or using the Things, you are agreeing to
be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not or cannot agree to
the terms of this License, please do not access or use the Things.

[[definitions]]
1. Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  _Licensor._ The Licensor under this License is defined in the file
called COPYRIGHT, that file describes how to contact the copyright
owner(s). If this license is used without this file, the license is still
valid.
2.  _Applicability._ This License applies to any data, software,
hardware, bioware, art, program or other work (the "Things(s)") which
Licensor makes available and which contains a notice placed by Licensor
identifying such work as subject to the terms of this Open Source
Eventually License (the "License").
3.  _Conversion Date._ The Conversion Date is the date upon which the
Pre-Release Products shall no longer be covered by this License and/or
the restrictions in the STARTINGLICENSE file and

earlier of a) the specific date detailed in the CONVERSIONDATE or b)
five years from the Effective Date herein.
4.  _Target License._ The conversion license is a Free/Libre Open Source

2. Grant of License
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  _Pre-Release Things._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License and to such royalties or fees assessed by Licensor, Licensor
hereby grants You, beginning on the Effective Date, a world-wide,
non-exclusive license, to the extent of Licensor's Applicable Rights and
copyrights for the Covered Products: to use, copy, modify, merge, and/or
internally deploy copies of the Pre-Release Products within your
organization subject to the following conditions:
2.  This license alone does not allow you to put the Things or the
"source" files for the Thing on the Internet for download.
3.  This license alone does not allow you to use this code to offer a
service to persons outside your organization.
4.  This license alone does not give You the right to use trademarks
from the Licensor in marketing to your clients, or otherwise imply that
the Licensor is endorsing you, your services or your company.
5.  This license alone does not give you the ability to transfer your
rights under this license to another individual or other entity. Each
entity must buy a separate copy of this license to use or modify the
Thing(s), until this license has reverted to the Target License. At that
time then contents of the Target License will dictate your right to
republish the Thing(s).
6.  _Extra Stuff you might have paid for._ This license is intentionally
restrictive. The Licensor might have sold you extra privileges that are
not provided for here. If the Licensor has provided you with extra
privileges, warranties or other things which contradict your Pre-release
rights under this document, those will be listed in a file called
STARTINGLICENSE.txt The contents of STARTINGLICENSE.txt can provide you with extra
privileges, but will not impact the conversion of this document into an
Free/Libre Open Source Document. If no STARTINGLICENSE.txt file exists, then
you only have the rights described in this document until the license
conversion occurs.
7.  _Post-Release Products._ On the Effective Date, the terms of this
license will be replaced entirely by the terms of the license found in
the TARGETLICENSE file. This file must be a Free/Libre Open Source
License or a Creative Commons License as defined on one of the following
sites:

* http://www.gnu.org/licenses/
* http://opensource.org/licenses
* http://creativecommons.org/licenses/

If the Licensor fails to include a copy of the TARGETLICENSE when you acquire your copy of the
Thing(s) then You have the right to release the Thing(s) under both the
Affero General Public License and the Creative Commons Share-Alike
Attribution License:

* http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt
* http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode

1.  _Calculating the Conversion Date._ Along with this file, there
should be a file titled CONVERSIONDATE. That file shall list the date
when this License shall convert to the Target License. However, that
conversion date shall be no more than two years from the Download Date.
If the CONVERSIONDATE file is missing, or unreadable or has date more
than five years from when you downloaded the data: You have the right to
create a new file called DOWNLOADDATE, that records the date which you
dowloaded the file. In order to prevent conflict please send the creator
of the Thing(s), and another public mailing list (i.e. the Thing(s)
community email list) an email indicating that you had to create a
DOWNLOADDATE file for your purchase and that you will convert the license
two years after that date. This email should include a copy of your receipt for your purchase of the Thing(s)
in question. The DOWNLOADDATE file for your purchase can
only be set to the date of your public email indicating that you are
using this option, and not the date mentioned on the receipt.

[[other-provisions]]
3. Other Provisions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  _Versions of the License._ Not Only Development may publish revised
and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Minor and de
minimis revisions to styling, numbering, or cosmetic changes will be
distinguished by a different commit value. Major revisions which affect
the material terms of this License will be given a distinguishing
version number. Once a Covered Thing and/or Modification has been
published under a particular version of this License, You may continue
to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
such Covered Things under the terms of any subsequent version of this
License published by NOD.
2.  _For original works only._ This license is not, itself, an Open
Source license. This cannot be used to meet obligations under Open
Source License. If the Licensor of the Thing(s) was obligated to
release the Things(s) because of another Open Source license, this
license does not fulfill that obligation. (i.e. if you download Linux,
which is under the GPLv2, and modify it, the Licensor cannot use this
license to do a GPL v2 OSE release, because the GPLv2 does not give the
Licensor the right to do that.
3.  _No Warranty or Support._ The Covered Products may contain in whole
or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered
Products may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data,
and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge
and agree that use of the Covered Products, or any portion thereof, is
at Your sole and entire risk. THE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION
OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THE PRODUCTS OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PRODUCTS.
