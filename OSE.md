##NOD Open Source Eventually License
Version 0.20

###Preamble

Everyone loves Free/Libre (as in "free speech") and Open Source Things! Now software, hardware, art and even bioware are available under licenses that respect the freedom of their users. However, it can be difficult to make money selling Open Source Things when those Things can be made available without cost (as in "free beer"). We need a way to be able to temporarily limit users freedoms in order to ensure that the creators of great Open Source stuff can pay mortgages and buy food. 

This license limits your freedom to share the Thing(s) (software, hardware, art, bioware, whatever) for a specific amount of time. During that time, only the original creator (Licensor) of the Thing(s) has the right to share this "thing". After a predetermined and reasonable amount of time, this license will automatically convert to an Free/Libre Open Source license, ensuring that you have the right to share the original Thing(s), and any improvements you have made to this Thing(s), under the terms of an Open Source License.

The files associated with the Thing(s) in question should include:

* OSELicense.md -> This license without modification.
* TARGETLICENSE.txt -> The Open Source License that this license will convert to.
* CONVERSTIONDATE.txt -> A file containing the date that conversion will take place
* COPYRIGHT.txt -> A file listing the Thing(s) copyright holder including an email address

The functioning of this license is simple. Creators (Licensors) make the Thing(s) (software/hardware/whatever) and then release them using these files, which detail what Open Source License the Thing(s) will convert to and when that conversion occurs. Further clarifications are included in the legalspeek below.


Please read this License carefully before accessing or using the licensed Things.  By accessing or using the Things, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this License.  If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this License, please do not access or use the Things.

  1. You must not put the Things or the source files on the Internet for a costless download
  2. You may not transfer your rights under this license to another individual or other entity. Each entity must buy a seperate copy of this license to use or modify the Thing(s), until this license has reverted to the Target License. That that time then contents of the Target License will dictate your right to republish the Thing(s)
2. _Post-Release Products._ On the Effective Date, the terms of this license will be replaced entirely by the terms of the license found in the TARGETLICENSE file. This file must be a Free/Libre Open Source License or a Creative Commons License as defined on one of the following sites:

* http://www.gnu.org/licenses/
* http://opensource.org/licenses
* http://creativecommons.org/licenses/

If the Licensor fails to include a copy of the TARGETLICENSE with the Thing(s) then You have the right to release the Thing(s) under both the Affero General Public License and the Creative Commons Share-Alike Attribution License:

* http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt

If the CONVERSIONDATE file is missing, or unreadable or has date more than two years from when you downloaded the data: You have the right to create a new file called DOWNLOADDATE, that records the date which you dowloaded the file. In order to prevent conflict please send the creator of the Thing(s), and another public mailing list (i.e. the Thing(s) community email list) an email indicating that you had to create a DOWNLOADATE file for your purchase and that you will convert the license two years after that date. The DOWNLOADDATE file for your purchase can only be set to the date of your public email indicating that you are using this option. 

###3. Other Provisions

1. _Versions of the License._  Not Only Development may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Minor and de minimis revisions to styling, numbering, or cosmetic changes will be distinguished by a different commit value. Major revisions which affect the material terms of this License will be given a distinguishing version number.  Once a Covered Thing and/or Modification has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Things under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by NOD.   

2. _For original works only._ This license is not, itself, an Open Source license. This cannot be used to meet obligations under Open Source Licenese. If the Licensor of the Thing(s) was obligated to release the Things(s) because of another Open Source licenses, this licenses does not fulfill that obligation. (i.e. if you download Linux, which is under the GPLv2, and modify it, the Licensor cannot use this license to do a GPL v2 OSE release, because the GPLv2 does not give the Licensor the right to do that.  

3. _No Warranty or Support._  The Covered Products may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The Covered Products may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.
